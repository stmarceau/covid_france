# study about french population and covid deaths
In oder to understand all figures provided by the french government, I decided to check whether I could investigate by myself to figure out what could be the consequence of covid-19 on the french people casualties.

To do so, I to 
* build up population data frame with history from 2000
* carried out a french population history review to better understand the obeserved death rate growth
* forecasted 2020 deaths based on previsous history
* compare 2020 forecast with real death count considered as covid casualties
